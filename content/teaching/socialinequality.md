“Who gets what, and why?“ is the key question in social inequality research. The course begins with an introduction to concepts and methods we will use to discuss and measure inequality. We then explore the social processes, structures and institutions through which inequality is reproduced and experienced in contemporary Germany and other advanced industrialized societies. The course discussions will focus on inequality in class, income, education, race/ethnicity and sex/gender.

The seminar will be held in English. Students can submit research papers in either English or German. Oral contributions are made in English, but occasional use of the German language is possible and is recommended when it serves clarity.
