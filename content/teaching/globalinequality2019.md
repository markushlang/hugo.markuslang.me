This course explores the mechanisms that drive inequality on a global scale. It begins with an introduction to concepts and methods we will use to discuss and measure inequality. We then explore the social processes, structures and institutions through which inequality is reproduced and experienced within and across countries. The course discussions will focus on the importance of land reform, womenâ€™s rights, communities of engineering practice and cross-border taxation.
